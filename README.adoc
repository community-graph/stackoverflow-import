== Neo4j StackOverflow Import for Community Graph (and other uses)

Currently uses Python and iPython Notebook, the StackOverflow API via requests.

Run the script and notebook server with these environment variables:

.nb.sh
----
cat ../nb.sh 
export NEO4J_URL=bolt://localhost
export NEO4J_USER=neo4j
export NEO4J_PASSWORD=****

ipython notebook 
----

=== Approach

* Use StackOverflow API with pre-authorized URL to retrieve data for the Neo4j tag
* Use idempotent Cypher statement to merge Questions, Users, Answers, Tags
* page over the data until all is imported

=== Data Model

Uses the StackOverflow part of this data model:

=== TODO

* store in json files and then import those
